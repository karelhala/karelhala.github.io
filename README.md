# karelhala.github.io
This repository was made entirely for testing out angular and material design, CV was picked because I could generate enough data for trying out c3.js graphs. All dependencies are lodaed via CDN so Github would not be tanked with requests.

You can reuse any part of this repository, just add some reference to this repo, thank you. If you fork this repository and just edit data, please do not remove fork me on github ribbon and don't change it to your repository.
