This repository was made entirely for testing out angular and material design, CV was picked because I could generate enough data for trying out c3.js graphs. All dependencies are lodaed via CDN so Github would not be tanked with requests.

You can reuse any part of this repository, just add some reference to this repo, thank you. If you fork this repository and just edit data, please do not remove fork me on github ribbon and don't change it to your repository.

### Documentation
If you are looking for how to use components from this repository and or how they were implemented go to [wiki](https://github.com/karelhala/karelhala.github.io/wiki) of this project and navigate to [Components](https://github.com/karelhala/karelhala.github.io/wiki/Components)

#### TODO
* Update this README
* Add tests
* Add Jsdoc and generate some kind of documantation from it

### Special thanks

Material design is perfect way of replacing bootstrap and jQuery, [angular material](https://material.angularjs.org/latest/) was really helpfull and [c3.js](http://c3js.org/) has amazing documentation.
these sites helped me achieve some amazing things:
* Timeline componet taken from: http://bootsnipp.com/snippets/featured/timeline-dotted
